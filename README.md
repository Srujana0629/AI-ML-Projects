## 1. Simple Chatbot for customers
Customers frequently ask about product details, return policies, and technical troubleshooting. Instead of handling every question manually, decided to implement a simple chatbot to provide quick responses.

Chatbot Will Handle Queries Like:
Product Information: “Tell me about product X”, “Do you have smartwatches?”
Return Policy: “What is your return policy?”, “How do I return a product?”
Technical Support: “My gadget won’t turn on”, “How do I reset my device?”

## 2.Predicting Building Energy Efficiency
Working for an architecture firm, and my task is to build a model that predicts the energy efficiency rating of buildings based on features like wall area, roof area, overall height, etc.
Used Random Forest Regressor and did few visualizations for insights.
